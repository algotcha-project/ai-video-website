# ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - Final Step

## What's Done:

1. ✅ **GitHub Repository Created & Pushed**
   - URL: https://github.com/algotcha-project/ai-video-website
   - All code is on GitHub
   - Ready for Vercel import

2. ✅ **Vercel Import Page Ready**
   - Repository is pre-filled
   - Framework will auto-detect as Next.js

## Final Step (30 seconds):

**The Vercel import page should be open in your browser.**

If you see the import page with the repository already selected:

1. **Verify settings:**
   - Project Name: `ai-video-website` (or leave default)
   - Framework Preset: Should show "Next.js"
   - Root Directory: Leave as `.` (default)

2. **Click "Deploy" button** (bottom right)

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

4. **Get your live URL:**
   - Format: `ai-video-website-xxxxx.vercel.app`
   - Will be shown on the deployment page

## If the page didn't open:

Go directly to:
```
https://vercel.com/new/import?repositoryUrl=https://github.com/algotcha-project/ai-video-website
```

Then click "Deploy"!
